# Multi-User Task Planner 

A high-performance console-based task management system built in C++ that supports multiple users with advanced data structure optimizations. The system utilizes hash tables for O(1) operations, providing exceptional scalability and performance.

# 🚀 Features

Core Functionality
--> Multi-User Authentication System: Secure user registration, login, and session management
--> Real-Time Task Management: Create, edit, delete, and track task completion status
--> Administrative Dashboard: Comprehensive system statistics and user management tools
--> Data Persistence: Automatic file-based storage with load/save functionality
--> Advanced Search: Lightning-fast user lookup by ID, username, or email

# Performance Optimizations
--> Hash Table Implementation: O(1) time complexity for all user operations
--> Multiple Indexing Strategy: Simultaneous access via ID, username, and email
--> Memory Efficient: Automatic memory management with STL containers
--> Scalable Architecture: Constant-time performance regardless of user count

# 🏗️ Architecture & Data Structures

# Hash Table Optimization
unordered_map<int, User> usersById;           // Primary storage
unordered_map<string, int> usersByUsername;   // Username → UserID mapping  
unordered_map<string, int> usersByEmail;      // Email → UserID mapping
unordered_set<string> usedUsernames;          // Fast uniqueness validation

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
--> Language: C++17
--> Data Structures: Hash Tables (unordered_map/set), Dynamic Arrays
--> Algorithms: Hashing, String Processing, File I/O
