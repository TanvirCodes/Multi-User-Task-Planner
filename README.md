# Multi-User-Task-Planner
This project aims to develop a console-based task planner system in C++ that supports multiple users, where each user can manage their own list of tasks. The system will use linked lists as the primary data structure to manage users and tasks. Each user will have a username and password, and their own linked list of tasks.
